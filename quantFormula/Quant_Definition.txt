1. Geometric Brownian Motion

A stochastic process St is said to follow a GBM if it satisfies the following stochastic differential equation (SDE):

dS{t}=mu * S{t} * dt + sigma * S{t} * dW{t}

where W_{t} is a Wiener process or Brownian motion, and \mu  ('the percentage drift') and \sigma  ('the percentage volatility') are constants.
The former is used to model deterministic trends, while the latter term is often used to model a set of unpredictable events occurring during this motion.

A geometric Brownian motion (GBM) (also known as exponential Brownian motion) is a continuous-time stochastic process
in which the logarithm of the randomly varying quantity follows a Brownian motion (also called a Wiener process) with drift.[1]
It is an important example of stochastic processes satisfying a stochastic differential equation (SDE); in particular,
it is used in mathematical finance to model stock prices in the Blackâ€“Scholes model.

   Three types of GBM: (drift + Brownian-Motion)

   a)  If the drift is 0, it is standard BM;
   b)  If the drift is constant, it is BM with constant drift;
   c)  If the drift is linear, it is geometric BM.

2.  Characterisations of the Wiener process

    The Wiener process {\displaystyle W_{t}}W_{t} is characterised by the following properties:[2]

    W{0}=0
    W has independent increments: for every t>0, the future increments W{t+u} - W{t}, u > 0 are independent of the past values W{s}, s <= t
    W has Gaussian increments: W{t+u} - W{t} is normally distributed with mean 0 and variance u, W{t+u} - W{t} => N(0,u)
    W has continuous paths: W{t} is continuous in t.

3. Log-normal distribution

   a)  a log-normal (or lognormal) distribution is a continuous probability distribution of a random variable whose logarithm is normally distributed.
   b)  Thus, if the random variable X is log-normally distributed, then Y = ln(X) has a normal distribution;
   c)  Equivalently, if Y has a normal distribution, then the exponential function of Y, X = exp(Y), has a log-normal distribution.

   d)  A random variable which is log-normally distributed takes only positive real values.
   e)  A log-normal process is the statistical realization of the multiplicative product of many independent random variables, each of which is positive.

4.  Central Limit Theorem

   a)  In probability theory, the central limit theorem (CLT) establishes that, in many situations, when independent random variables are summed up,
       their properly normalized sum tends toward a normal distribution (informally a bell curve) even if the original variables themselves are not normally distributed.
   b)  For example, suppose that a sample is obtained containing many observations, each observation being randomly generated in a way that does not
       depend on the values of the other observations, and that the arithmetic mean of the observed values is computed. If this procedure is performed many times,
       the central limit theorem says that the probability distribution of the average will closely approximate a normal distribution.

   c)  The earliest version of this theorem, that the normal distribution may be used as an approximation to the binomial distribution
