/**
 * In this class, we try to use Analytic method to solve the Black-Scholes model
 * We will try numerical method later to solve Black-Scholes model.
 *
 * BSM assumes that:
 * 1) risk-free rate is constant, volatility is constant;
 * 2) the underlying asset prices S follow Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM), which are log-normal distribution.
 *    However, under GBM, asset / stock price return is generally normal bell curve distribution, with mean = 0
 *
 * In probability theory, a log-normal (or lognormal) distribution is a continuous
 * probability distribution of a random variable whose logarithm is normally distributed.
 * Thus, if the random variable X is log-normally distributed, then Y = ln(X) has a normal distribution.
 * Equivalently, if Y has a normal distribution, then the exponential function of Y, X = exp(Y), has a log-normal distribution.
 *
 * Analytic solution (under It√¥'s interpretation):
